# KISS
Kodi's Improved Server Selector (for Sapari)

# What is KISS?

KISS is a simple GUI utility for changing the servers of your Sapari world files. If you don't know what a Sapari is, you probably should check that out before hanging out here.
When I first joined the Sapari community, the Server Selector was fairly out of date and frankly a bit too minimal for my taste. KISS introduces a couple of new features to the table:

  - Saving and switching between multiple user-defined servers
  - Switching the servers for only select files
  - A centralised Server Index to allow for server discovery

# How do I use KISS?
## Using a pre-packaged binary

You can navigate to the Releases tab and download the latest release matching your operating system. Extract the archive and execute the "main" executable.
For ease of use, you may want to create a Shortcut to the program in some other location.

## Using the source code

KISS depends on the following python packaged that can be installed through pip:

  - `PyQt5`
  - `requests`
  
 Simply install both of those and then run `main.py`!
 
 # Usage
 
 Once you have KISS open, first make sure the Options are correct. Then, head to the Server Selector tab amd select a server as well as some files you want to edit. Click "Apply" and watch the magic happen!
